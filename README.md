# ðŸ’³ Simple Banking System

## Preamble

This project implements a simple banking application utilizing a single-page web application GUI. The application should be capable of 3 main features:

- depositing an amount
- withdrawing an amount
- printing account statement

I have structured this app so that a Navbar is available for easy navigation. The app starts with user being Logged Out. Simply click "LOG IN" on the top right to update the logged in state. No actual API is called for updating this state. <b>Depositing</b> and <b>Withdrawing</b> are done through the <u>Transfer</u> tab. <b>Printing account statements</b> is done through the <u>Statement</u> tab. I have ensured that the design is responsive for mobile screens as well, with an adaptive UI.

The github repository can be found here: https://github.com/kiblykat/simple-bank-app.

For quick viewing, a deployed version of this app can be accessed here:
