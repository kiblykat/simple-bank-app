# ðŸ’³ Simple Banking System

## Preamble

This project implements a simple banking application utilizing a single-page web application GUI. The application should be capable of 3 main features:

- depositing an amount
- withdrawing an amount
- printing account statement

I have structured this app so that a Navbar is available for easy navigation. <b>Depositing</b> and <b>Withdrawing</b> are done through the <u>Transfer</u> tab. <b>Printing account statements</b> is done through the <u>Statement</u> tab. I have ensured that the design is responsive for mobile screens as well, with an adaptive UI.

The github repository can be found here: https://github.com/kiblykat/zenika-client-final.

3. Open command line, run "npm i" to download the relevant dependencies and generate the /node_modules folder
4. run "npm run dev" to start the development mode. By default, the vite server will run on http://localhost:5173/

### Testing

1. To run the unit tests, type "npm run test"
2. To run integration tests, first ensure dev environment is running. type "npm run dev" in terminal
